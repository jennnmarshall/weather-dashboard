# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project creates a dashboard the makes calls to the OpenWeather API and displays the current weather conditions for a searched city as well as the five day forecast in metric units. The user's search history is saved and displayed in a side bar list that allows the user to click on their previous searches to search that city again. The five day forecast displays data from the afternoon of the given day, for the most accurate idea of the temperature highs.  The link to the deployed site is below:
